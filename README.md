# titanic
This is my first Data Science Project. I've choosen the Titanic dataset because it is the first competition available on Kaggle.

## What expect from this notebook
Be aware that this was my first attempt of doing a Machine Learning and Data Science project, so the main purpose of this notebook was to learning.

There are errors and improvements to be maid, so I pretend to come back to this notebook in the future. If you are new to this world, this can help you as a starting point, however, do not rely on it as a main source of studies. See what I've done and find my mistakes, I guarantee you that there are many.
